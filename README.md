# ICPC Assiut University Training Solutions in Python

A comprehensive collection of Python solutions for the ICPC Assiut University Training Sheets and Contests. This repository serves as a resource for competitive programmers preparing for ICPC competitions.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by contest sheets and training categories:

```
├── Contest #1
├── Contest #2
├── Sheet #1 (Data Types)
├── Sheet #2 (Loops)
├── Sheet #3 (Arrays)
├── Sheet #5 (Functions)
└── Sheet #6 (Math)
```

## Solutions Coverage

This repository includes solutions for:
- Basic programming concepts
- Data structures implementation
- Algorithm problems
- Mathematical challenges
- String manipulation
